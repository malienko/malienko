Hi, I'm Anton Malienko, an Enterprise SEO Consultant based in Montreal, Canada.

## About Me

I'm an SEO consultant with 11+ years of technical and ecommerce SEO experience. I've worked with 50+ B2C and B2B enterprise-level clients and large-scale websites. I independently grew an affiliate site to $1M+ in assisted sales in 3 years, and I help businesses scale through strategy, automation and AI.

## Background

I'm an ex-research scientist with several publications on the interplay between attention and action, movement planning, and retinal function correlations with mood disorders. My current career in digital marketing has pushed my research interests towards practical uses of technology for business needs.

## Current Research Interests

The switch from neuroscience and optometry to digital marketing and technology reflects my ability to apply scientific knowledge to solve real-world digital challenges:

- Automating Technical SEO Processes with Python
- Content SEO with Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Computer Vision for Labelling Ecommerce Images

I leverage programming and machine learning to enhance SEO processes, by automating technical audits, using computer vision techniques for efficient ecommerce image labeling, and NLP for content SEO.
